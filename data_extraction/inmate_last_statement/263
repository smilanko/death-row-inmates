 First of all, I would like to apologize to the Guajardo family even though they are not present. I loved Yolanda a lot. I hope and pray they can forgive me for all the pain. To my family, stay strong. Tom, Orlando, Celia, stay strong. Michael, thank you for your friendship. Thank you for the support you have given me. I thank all of you and I love all of you. To the guys on death row, stay strong and I hope to see you someday. Bye bye, I love you guys, don't worry about me. It's going to be alright.
