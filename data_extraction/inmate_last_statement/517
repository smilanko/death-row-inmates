 I just want to tell my family  I love them; my son, I love him. The girls on the row, I love them and keep  their heads up. Tell Darlie I love her, hand in hand. God bless y'all. I'm  alright. Tell them I finished strong. I love y'all. I'm done. I love you,  Richie. I love you. Thank you, Brad and John, all of y'all. God is good. I love  you, Auntie. I'm done.
