  Yeah.  I want to thank my family and friends; my family for all loving me and giving me so much love.  I am sorry; I really am.  You, Brian's sister, thanks for your love --  it meant a lot.  Shane -- I hope he finds peace.  I am sorry I destroyed you all's life.  Thank you for forgiving me.  To the moon and back -- I love you all.
