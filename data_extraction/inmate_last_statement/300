 I would like to say first and foremost to the Lord God Almighty that I am sorry and forgive me of every single solitary sin I have committed these 35 years I have lived upon this Earth.  To the Varghese family, I would ask that you forgive me because I know you have suffered a great loss and I am truly, truly sorry.  I know what you have suffered, but please grant me your forgiveness.  I am truly sorry, and there is not a day that I have not prayed for you.  And to my Mom, I love you.  I am going to see the Lord.  The Lord is my Shepherd.  Let everyone know that I love them; this is not goodbye.  I will see you later.
