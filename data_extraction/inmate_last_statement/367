  Yeah.  Momma, I just want you to know I love you.  I want all of you to know I love you all.  I am at peace; we know what it is.  We know the truth.  Stay out of crime; there is no point in it.  I am at peace.  We know the truth and I know it.  I have some peace.  I am glad it didn't take that long - no 10 or 20 years.  I am at peace.  And I want everyone to know I did not walk to this because this is straight up murder.  I just want everybody to know I didn't walk to this.  The reason is because it's murder.  I am not going to play a part in my own murder.  No one should have to do that.  I love you all.  I do not know all of your names.  And I don't know how you feel about me.  And whether you believe it or not, I did not kill them.  I just want you all to have peace; you know what I'm saying.  There is no point in that.  It is neither here nor there.  You have to move past it.  It is time to move on.  You know what I'm saying.  I want each one of my loved ones to move on.  I am glad it didn't last long.  I am glad it didn't last long.  I am at peace.  I am at peace to the fullest.  The people that did this - they know.  I am not here to point fingers.  God will let them know.  If this is what it takes, just do what you got to do to get past it.  What it takes.  I am ready, Warden.  Love you all.  Let my son know I love him.
