 First I would like to praise my Lord Jesus  Christ.  I ask for forgiveness to the Thomas Family for my past choices I  made.  Carol did not deserve for what I’ve done.  I’ve asked God to  forgive me.  Please find it in your hearts to forgive me.  I’m sorry  it has been bothering me for a long time.  So I now pray and I will keep  you all in my prayers.  I hope you find it in your heart to forgive  me.  I’m sorry. To my supporters Daniel, brother Charlie, Steve and all  who stood by me, thank you.  By no means am I happy for what I’ve  done.  I have asked the Lord to forgive me.  Please tell everyone I’m  certain I left off some names.  Tell my kids I’m sorry for being a  disappointment.  Thank you. God bless.  I’m ready warden.
