  First of all, I want to say God bless everyone here today.  For many years I have done things my way, which caused a lot of pain to me, my family and many others.  Today I have come to realize that for peace and happiness, one has to do things God's way.  I want to thank my family for their support.  I love you.  I am taking you with me.  You all stay strong.  I love you.  I also want to say thanks to the Chaplains who I have met through the years and who have brought me a long way.  And I cherish you as my family and at this time...oh, Ken, my little son, I am coming to see you.  Oh Lord, into your hands I commit my spirit.  Thy will be done.
