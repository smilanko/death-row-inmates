 Yes sir.  Sorry that I have to put my family through this.  All of you know I got my peace.  And I hope you find peace.  And to the family, the truth will come out and I hope you find peace.  I got my peace.  I hope everybody has their peace.  I am tired.  I am going to be in your heart.  I love you all.  To everybody else, the truth will be known.  It didn't come out in time to save my life.  It is wrong to put the families through this.  But when it comes out, I hope it stops this.  It is wrong for the prosecutors to lie and make witnesses say what they need them to say.  The truth has always been there.  I just hope everybody has their peace.  Today I get mine.  I love you all.
