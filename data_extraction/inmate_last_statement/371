  Yes, I would like to make a short brief one please.  To Audrey's grandmother, I am sorry for the pain I have caused you for the last 15 years and your family.  I have regretted this for a long time.  I am sorry.  I only ask that you remember the Lord because He remembers us and He forgives us if we ask Him.  I am sorry.  And to my family, and my loved ones - I am sorry for the pain for all those years and for putting you through all the things we had to go through.  I ask the Lord to bless you all.  Tammy, Irene, Betty, Dan Judy - I love you all.  And Jack, thank you.  Warden...
