  Yes sir.  I would like to ask you to forgive me.  I made a mistake and I am sorry for what I did.  All I can do is ask you to forgive me.  I love you and I will see all of you in Heaven.  I love you very much.  Praise Jesus.  I love you.  Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us.  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.  Amen.
