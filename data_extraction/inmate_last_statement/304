  Can you hear me, Chris?  The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want.  He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters.  He restores my soul;  He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me;  Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me.  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies;  Thou anointest my head with oil;  My cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. I want to thank you for being there with me all these years and supporting me and keeping me in the Word.  Michael, you take care of her and thank you Father Don and Chris.  And I want to thank the media for being nice to me all this time.  Bye, Chris.  I will see you.  Take care of yourselves and you all stay strong.  You keep doing your ministry.
