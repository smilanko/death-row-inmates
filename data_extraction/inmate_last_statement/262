  Yes.  My last statement.  I was wrongfully convicted of this crime against Michael Watkins and James Williams on 10th Street on August 31, 1993.  I got convicted on a false confession because I never admitted to it, but my lawyer did not put this out to the jury.  I did not kill those drug dealers.  I send love to my family and friends; my east side family and friends.  I am being real with the real.  That's all that counts in my heart.  I will see you later.  That's it.
