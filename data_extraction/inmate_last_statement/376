  To my family and my mother and my three precious daughters, I love you all.  And to my brother and sister for standing with me throughout this situation.  Stay strong and know that I'm in a better place.  I ask for forgiveness.  And to the victim's family, find peace and cancellation with my death and move on.  Our Lord Jesus Christ, I commend myself to you.  I am ready.
