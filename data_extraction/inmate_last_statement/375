  Yes I do.  Debbie, my Baby, I love you; do you know I love you.  You are my life.  You are my wife - always stay strong.  Stay strong everybody.  I am innocent.  I am being punished for a crime I did not commit.  I have professed my innocence for nine years, and I continue to say I am innocent.  Let my people know I love them.  We must continue on.  Do not give up the fight; do not give up hope for a better future.  Because we can make it happen.  I love you, I love my son, and I love my daughter.  Bruno, Chuckie, Juanita, Ray - I love you, all of you.  Stay strong baby.  I love you forever.
