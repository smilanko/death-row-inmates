 I am sorry for the pain: sorry for what I caused my friends, family and loved ones.  I feel a great deal of responsibility and guilt for all this crime.  I should be punished for the crime, but I do not think I should die for a crime I did not commit.  I am sorry, but nothing can bring Kim, Ollie, and Gigi back.  But I pray my death brings peace for my family that may unite the family.  I ask for your forgiveness and that you will all forgive me.  I have no animosity;  I am at peace and invite you all to my funeral.  We are still family.  I love you all, Momma, Aunt Deidra, family and everybody.  I love you.  I am ready, Warden.
