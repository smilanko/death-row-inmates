  I do, I would like to tell everybody that I'm sorry about the situation that happened.  My bad - everybody is here because of what happened.  I'd like to thank everybody that's been here through the years.  The little kids overseas - they really changed me.  Sister Doris, mom, brothers, sister, dad; I love ya'll.  My brother... where's my stunt double when you need one?  My Lord is my life and savior, nothing shall I fear.
