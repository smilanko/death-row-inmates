  Yes sir, members of Mrs. Sanchez's family, I don't know who you are and other people present.  As I said, I'm taking responsibility fro the death of your daughter in 1983.  I'm deeply sorry for the loss of your loved one.  I am a human being also.  I know how it feels, I've been there.  I cannot explain and can't give you answers.  I can give you one thing, and I'm going to give that today.  I'm give a life for a life.  I pray you will have no ill will or animosity.  You have the right to see this, I am glad you are here.  All I can do is ask the Lord for forgiveness.  I am not saying this to be facetious.  I am giving my life.  I hope you find comfort in my execution.  As for me, I am happy, that is why you see me smiling.  I am glad I am leaving this world.  I am going to a better place.  I have made peace with God, I am born again.  Thank you for being here, I'm sorry.  I hope you get over any malice or hatred you feel.  Because it yields sorrow and suffering.  I take responsibility for the loss of your daughter.  I can't give answers.  I hope you can find peace in the days to come.  God bless all of you.  Thank you all for being here. Begins singing:  Amazing Grace
