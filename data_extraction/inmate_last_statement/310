  I would like for Rosalyn's family and loved ones and my wife, Mary's, family to know that I am genuinely sorry for what I did.  I would like you to reach down in your hearts and forgive me.  There is no excuse for what I did.  Rosalyn's mother asked me at the trial, "Why?" and I do not have a good reason for it.  Please forgive me.  As for my friends and family here - thanks for sticking with me and know that I love you and will take part of you with me.  I would like to thank one of the arresting officers that I would have killed if I could have.  He gave me CPR, saved my life, and gave me a chance to get my life right.  I know I will see Mary and Rosalyn tonight.  I love you all.
