  Well, yes, sir.  Rebecca, I understand that you wanted this day to come, you got what you wanted.  I didn't kill your mother.  The two guys that worked for me killed your mother and they are still out there.  If Mr. McDougal had allowed the DNA evidence, I would be exonerated.  Mr. Tolson, I understand you are out there.  If there is any justice in this world, please use this to keep other people from being where I'm at.  Warden, this is murder just as surely as the people that killed Rebecca's mother.  Send me home.
