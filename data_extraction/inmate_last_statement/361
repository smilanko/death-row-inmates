  Yes.  Yes, I do.  Do I just talk to the front?  O.K.  To everybody on both sides of that wall--I want you to know I love you.  I am sorry that the child had to lose her life, but I should not have to be here.  Tell my family I love them all and I will see them in Heaven.  Come home when you can.  I am done.  Love you all.
