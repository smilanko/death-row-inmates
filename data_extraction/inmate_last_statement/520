 Joanna I really love and care about her, I appreciate  her.  There is a drawing that I forgot to tell you about, send it to  Stacy.  Art, I appreciate you.  Joanna, tell my family I love them  all.  Trix I love you too.   Teresa I am really sorry, please don’t have hate in your  heart.  I really feel like this.  I hope you can find peace in your  heart and happiness.  A revenge death won’t get you anything.   Joanna, I love you.  Let’s ride.
