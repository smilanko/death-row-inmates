 To the media, I would like for you to tell all the victims and their loved ones that I am truly, truly sorry for taking their loved ones' lives.  And I hope they will find it in their heart to forgive me for what I did to them.  I am a different person now, but that does not change the fact of the bad things I have committed.  God can give you the same peace He gave me and you can be in His hands.  And to my beautiful family, be strong.  Remember what I said, "God is the Way, the Truth, and the Life."  OK, Warden.
