 Yes, I would like to praise Allah and I am praying to Allah. Allah is most gracious. I will ask Allah for forgiveness because he created me and he will forgive me. All of the brothers on the row stay strong. I love my family, my mother. I will see her sooner or later. Life goes on. Donâ€™t let these people break you. Keep true to nature. You do not have to act like them. Rise above it. Praise Allah
