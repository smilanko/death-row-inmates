  I do.  I am sorry.  I have always been sorry.  It is the worst mistake that I ever made in my whole life.  Not because I am here, but because of what I did and I hurt a lot of people - you, and my family.  I am sorry; I have always been sorry.  I am sorry.  You look after each other.  I love you all.  Be there for one another.  Alright.  But I am sorry; very sorry.  I love you too.  Alright.
