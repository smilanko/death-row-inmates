 I would like to thank  all of the supporting people who helped me over the years.  To mad Maddie,  my twin Sonja, Angie, and all the homies.  AKA money and Peruvian queen  including crazy Dominican.  I was so glad to leave this world a better,  more positive place.  It’s not an easy life with all the  negativities.  Love all my friends and all the friendship’s that I have  made.  They are like the sky.  It is all part of life, like a big  full plate of food for the soul.  I hope I left everyone a plate of food  full of happy memories, happiness and no sadness.  I’m done warden.
