 I’d like to take a moment to say I’m sorry.  No  amount of words could ever undo what I’ve done.  To the family of my  victims, I wish I could undo that past.  It is what it is.  God bless  all of you, I will die with a clear conscience.  I made my peace. There is  no others.  I would like to wish a Happy Birthday to Barbara Carrol, today  is her birthday.  I would like to especially thank those that have helped  me, you know who you are.  God bless everybody until we meet again.   I’m ready warden.
