 I would like to apologize for all of the hurt, pain and disappointment I caused to my family and all my friends.  I hope all the veterans and teenagers out there who have a drug problem will get help.  I hope the lord will forgive me of all of my sins.  I thank Jack and Kathy for being with me.  I hope that those who support the Death Row inmates will continue to work and maybe we can get this resolved and do away with the Death Penalty.  I hope this is a lot better place where I am going.
