 Shelby, God bless your heart.  To my family, I  love them and everybody that showed support.  Thank you to all of my  cousins and aunts and uncles that showed support and that prayed for me.   From California to New York thank you for all of your support.  Pope  Francis, God’s children has asked the State of Texas to switch my death  sentence to life in prison.  But the State of Texas has refused to listen  to God’s children, they will have to take that up with God.  Let everyone  know it’s not over.  To Wesley Ruiz aka Slope, keep your head up, keep  your faith in God.  To my family I love y’all.  That’s it Warden.
