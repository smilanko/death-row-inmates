 To Kathy’s family and friends that were unable to attend today, I am truly sorry. I hope my dropping my appeal has in some way began your healing process. This is all I am going to do to help you out in any way for the nightmare and pain that I have caused you, but I am truly sorry and I wish I could take back what I did, but I can’t. I hope this heals you. To my family: I love you. When the tears flow, let the smiles grow. Everything is all right. To my family: I love you. Warden, ATW.
