  Jennifer, where are you at?  I'm sorry, I did not know the man but for a few seconds before I shot him.  It was done out of fear, stupidity, and immaturity.  It wasn't until I got locked up and saw the newspaper.  I saw his face and his smile and I knew he was a good man.  I am sorry for all your family and my disrespect - he deserved better.  Sorry Gus.  I hope all the best for you and your daughters.  I hope you have happiness from here on out.  Quit the heroin and methadone.  I love you dad, Devin, and Walt.  We're done Warden.
