  I'll start by saying I love all of you.  I will be waiting for your arrival, don't disappoint me by not showing up.  I will be there with the give of Christ.  We'll all be there.  I promise I'll go up smiling.  I am sorry.  If I could think of a word in the vocabulary stronger, you need to hear something stronger, you deserve it.  I'm sorry, I can't take back what I have done.  I have asked Christ for forgiveness, and I ask that you forgive me.  And I understand your feelings.  God bless all of you.  I will be waiting for your arrival.  Do not disappoint me by not showing up.  God bless everybody.
