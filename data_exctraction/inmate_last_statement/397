  Yes, I do.  I thank the Lord for giving me my friends, for getting me the ones I love.  Lord reach down and help innocent men on death row.  Lee Taylor needs help, Bobby Hines, Steve Woods.  Not all of us are innocent, but those are.  Cleve Foster needs help.  Melyssa, I love you girl.  I know I wasn't going to say anything, but I've got to.  Jack, Irene, Danny, Doreen, I love you guys.  I said I was going to tell a joke.  Death has set me free.  That's the biggest joke, I deserve this.  And the other joke is I am not Patrick Bryan Knight, and ya'll can't stop this execution now.  Go ahead, I'm finished.  Come on, tell me Lord.  I love you Melyssa, take care of that little monster for me.
