 “I would like to thank you.  I hope this execution  helps my family and also the victim’s family.  This was never meant to be,  sure beyond my power. I can only walk the path before me and make the best of  it.  I am sorry for putting y’all through this.  I am sorry, I love  you.  I am ready.  May we all go to Heaven.  Thank you Warden Jones.”
