 Hi ladies I wanted to  tell ya’ll how much I love you. Thank you for being here for me. You have  brought pleasure into my life in the short time I lived and known ya’ll. Ya’ll  are very special not just to me but to the unit. There are so many lives that  yall have touched over there that yall don’t even know about that guys talk  about in the back .I am at peace now with and going to be with Jesus and my  family. I am going to miss those pancakes and those old time black and white  shows. Where I am going everything will be in color. There is a lot of this I  don’t understand but the system is not completely right. It’s not completely  wrong but, it is something that has to be done until something better comes  along. But, I am at peace with that and I am ok and I can live with that. The  15 or 16 years that I have been on death row I have never had a case that  doesn’t mean that I am a good guy or nothing I have the Lord in my heart and He  has given me peace I will be honest with you. I am going to go tell your mother  and David I am glad you made it and you didn’t pass out on the line. OK Warden  I am ready.
