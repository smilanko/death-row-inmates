  Hello, ain't got to worry about nothing. I am going home. I hope to see all of ya'll one day. Lord have mercy on my soul. For the Flake family, stay strong. It's bad to see a man get murdered for something he didn't do, but I am taking it like a man, like a warrior. I am going home to Jesus. I love ya'll, peace. Iam ready sir... Don't forget to tell my daughter,,, I am ready, Warden.
