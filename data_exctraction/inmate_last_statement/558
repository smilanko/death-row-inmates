 Yes Sir, I would like to thank the Shape Community  Center for all their support. I would like to thank all those overseas, Italy  and France, for their support for the death row prisoners. I would also like to  apologize to Lori for the second time for her husband dying at my hand. To the  White family and to Tashell for not being there, I Love you. I’m finished  Warden you may proceed.
