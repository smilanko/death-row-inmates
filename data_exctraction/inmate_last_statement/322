 Statement to what.  State What.  I am not guilty of the charge of capital murder.  Steal me and my family's money.  My truth will always be my truth.  There is no kin and no friend; no fear what you do to me.  No kin to you undertaker.  Murderer.  [Portion of statement omitted due to profanity] Get my money.  Give me my rights.  Give me my rights.  Give me my rights.  Give me my life back.
