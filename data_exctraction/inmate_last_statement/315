  Yes sir.  I would like to thank God for all the blessings He has given me.  And I pray that through His mercy, He will allow me into His grace.  And to the family of Ms. Ayers, I would like to apologize for all the pain and suffering and that God gives you closure.  And I pray that He blesses you.  And to my family, know that I love every single one of you and pray that God gives you peace and strength.  I may not be with you in the physical, but by grace, my heart will be with you all and I know God loves every one of you all.
