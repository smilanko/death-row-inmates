  Written  To the families of Ms. Thompson and Ms. Cutler. I am sorry for what happened and that it was because of me that they are gone.  If there were any way I could change things and bring them back I would. But I can't.  Because of what I caused to happen many people were affected and I am very sorry that I did.  I have made my peace with God and I pray that soon everyone will be able to have closure in their hearts and lives.  To my family and friends, I love you and some day we will all be together again.
