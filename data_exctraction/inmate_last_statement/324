  Yes I do.  I want to tell everyone, my family, thanks for standing by me.  I want to tell Mr. and Ms. Gray and everyone that I didn't do what I did to hurt you all.  I am sorry that I did what I did.  I don't think you know the true reason for doing what I did, but Brandy and I had a suicide pact and I just didn't follow through with it.  That did not come out in the trial.  I am not trying to hurt you by telling you this.  I am trying to tell you the truth.  I want Cindy to know that I know she is out there -- and Vicente Hernandez that I love them.  Thank you for all you have done and I want to make sure you are alright.  That is all I want to say.  I am ready.  See you later.  I am ready.
