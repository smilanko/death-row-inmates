 Ya'll know I love you, you too Ward.  You have been a good friend.  You are a good investigator.  Doug, I thank you for coming from Michigan.  Chris and David, I love you.  Thank them for their support Doug.  Debra, James, I'm not crying so you don't cry.  Don't be sad for me.  I'm going to be with God, Allah, and Momma.  I'm gonna ask dad why didn't give you away at your wedding.  Randy Greer, my little brother, I'll be watching you, stay out of trouble.  All my nieces and nephews, I love you all.  Sammie, Vincent, and Yolanda, I will be watching over you all. The reason it took them so long is because they couldn't find a vein.  You know how I hate needles - I used to stay in the Doctor's Office.  Tell the guys on Death Row that I'm not wearing a diaper.  I can't think of anything else.  You all stay strong.  Now you can put this all aside.  Don't bury me in the prison cemetery.  Bury me right beside momma.  Don't bury me to the left of dad, bury me on the right side of mom. Kim Schaeffer, you are a evil woman.  You broke the law.  The judges and courts helped you and you didn't have all the facts.  When you look at the video, you know you can't see anyone.  You overplayed your hand looking for something against me and to cover it up the State is killing me.  I'm not mad or bitter though.  I'm sad that you are stuck here and have to go through all of this.  I am going somewhere better.  My time is up.  Let me get ready to make my transition.  Doug, don't forget Marcy.
