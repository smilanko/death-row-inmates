 Ms. Craft and Ms. Bethrie, I donâ€™t know what to say to you   but I apologize for the pain I have caused you and your family over the years. I   hope that you will accept my apology and that you will know that it is sincere.   I hope this will allow you and your family to move on and I hope you will   forgive me and I hope Mr. Hanon [illegible] will forgive me for taking   his life. Please accept my apology. I love you all. I am finished.
