  I want to apologize to you, and I am sorry.  I have made a lot of mistakes in my life.  The things I did changed so many lives.  I can't take it back, it was an atrocity.  I am sorry.  I beg your forgiveness, I know I am not worthy of it.  I love you Mom and Dad, and all my family.  Thank you for everything.  Jesus, thank you for your love and saving grace.  Thank you for shedding your blood on Calvary for me.  Thank you Jesus for the love you have shown me.
