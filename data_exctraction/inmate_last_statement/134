 First, I would like to give praise to God for the love and grace that he has allowed for all of this to come together. I would like to thank and ask blessings for all of the men who are imprisoned and have shared in my struggle and have allowed me to help them. I would like to thank my family for their blessings and for sharing my struggle and having been there for me and endured this with me. I would like to thank the Chaplain and all the rest who have offered their prayers.
