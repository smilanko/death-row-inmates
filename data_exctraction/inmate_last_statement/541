 “Yes sir, I would first like to say to the Sanchez family  how sorry I am.  Words cannot begin to express how sorry  I am and  the hurt that I have caused you and your family.  May this bring you peace  and forgiveness. I am sorry. To my family, thank you for all your love and support.   I am at peace.  Jesus Christ is Lord.  I love you all.  Thank  you Warden that is it.”
