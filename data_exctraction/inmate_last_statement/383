  You know, once upon a time diamonds were priceless.  I never knew until I ran across my own.  I just want Eve to know that.  One of these days I'm going to return and get that for myself.  Thank you to my family, I love you.  Each and every one of you.  This is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter for you and I together forever.  I love you all.  Remember what I told you Brad.  Ms. Irene, God bless you, I love you.  See you on the other side.  Warden, murder me.  Saddam and Gomorrah which is Harris County.
