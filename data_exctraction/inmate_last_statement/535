 Yeah, first off, I want to say that I am sorry for the  pain that I have caused you people.  I am sorry that I cannot bring  everybody back.  I wish it could be different.  I know it would be  hard for you to understand what went on that night, I can’t bring them back as  much as I would like to.  I love my daughter and all of my  supporters.  I pray that the Lord take care of me and all of you.  I  have no bad sentiment towards anyone.  I can understand your outrage and  why you are mad at me.  God be with all of us.
