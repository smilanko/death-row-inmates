  Yes.  Well here we are again folks, in the catacombs of justice.  You know there is a lot I wanted to say - a lot I thought I'd say - but there is not a whole lot to say.  There are people that will be mad thinking I try to seek freedom from this, but as long as I see - freedom belongs to me and I'll keep on keeping on.  The shackles and chains that just might hold my body can't hold my mind, but will kill me otherwise.  I love you momma, and Misty and Annette, Brenda and Anthony - and all my friends and everybody that supported me.  I leave my love here; I am never going to stop loving you.  My love is going to stay here.
