 Yes sir, I want to tell my mom that I love her and thank her for everything that she has done for me. Tell my sister that I love her too thank her for everything that she has done for me. I hope you can move on after this. I'll be fine. I'll be O.K. I love you too. I love you too. Take care O.K. That's all I have to say Warden. Thank you sir.
