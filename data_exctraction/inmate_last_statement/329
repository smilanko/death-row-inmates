 Yes sir, I would.  To the West Family, I would just like to apologize for your loss.  I hope that you can forgive me.  To my family and loved ones and friends, I thank all of you all for your support and I am sorry for the pain and hurt I have caused you.  I love you all and I will see you on the other side.  O.K. Warden.
