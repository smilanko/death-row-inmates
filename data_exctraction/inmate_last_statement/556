 I am very thankful for all the hard work the Mexican  consulate put in a fight over my death sentence if there was a reason or not. I  am thankful for the humane treatment that I was given here at the  2 prisons that I was at. I am getting my gold watch that it took the  Governor 30 years to forge. Thank you God, Lord send me a chariot. I’m ready.
