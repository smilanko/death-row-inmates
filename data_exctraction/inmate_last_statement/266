  Yes, sir.  I want to give thanks to Father Walsh, my spiritual advisor and Mr. Whiteside and Irene Wilcox and her husband, Jack, and Richard Lopez for being there for me through all of this.  I don't see O'Brien.  Oh, there he is. Thanks to everybody.  Everybody will be all right, because y'all are going where I am going.  Remember what I said, I want to see you all where I'm going.  I want to give thanks.  God, come and do Your will.  I'm ready Warden.
