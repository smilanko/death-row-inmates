  Yes sir, Thank you.  I love y'all and I want y'all to know that.  Y'all always told me not to worry about myself.  I worry more about you all because I know where I am going.  I want to see you there, so get your heart right.  You know I love you and care for you.  I am going to go with my little boy and play with him.  Y'all take care and I love y'all.  I love y'all.  Chaplain Wilcox, Roger, Robin, Sarah, Grandma.  I love you.  Y'all be careful.  Lord Jesus, I see your Spirit, it's o.k.  I love you.
