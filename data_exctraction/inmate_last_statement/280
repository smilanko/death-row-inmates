  Spoken: I would like to say goodbye to a good friend of mine in Switzerland - Diego.  I appreciate all the help and support he gave me through the years.  A friend of mine in England.  Wildflower:  I love you and will never forget you.  And to my family.  That's all.  Written: I wish to tell the family how sorry I am about what I done.  I know that nothing I say will bring Mr. and Mr. Bo Simmons back.  I ask that if Linda and Gary and their family can find it in their hearts to forgive me, but if not, I will understand.  I am truly sorry.
