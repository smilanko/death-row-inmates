 Yes sir. To Edie, Tom, and and Carma - I love all you all.  I appreciate all your support.  I love you Margherita, Father Guido, and Father Angelo.  I appreciate your spiritual support and all those that were in prayer for me.  I will be O.K.  I am at peace with all of this and I won't have to wake up in prison any more.  I love you all.  I totally surrender to the Lord.  I am ready, Warden.
