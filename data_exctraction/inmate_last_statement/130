 I would like to say to the Magee family and the Cadena family that I was friends with David and Virginia and I did not commit this offense. I have tried to do something to compensate the families by writing a book. I would like for the proceeds to go to the Magee family and the Cadena family. There is someone who will be contacting them or they can get in touch with my attorney. I would like to thank you for standing by me and loving me and carry my best to my "sun," my butterfly. Goodbye, sun, I love you.
