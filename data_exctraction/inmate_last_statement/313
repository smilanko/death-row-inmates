  Yes sir, I do.  I would like to thank everybody for coming out tonight and celebrating life.  This is a celebration of life, not death.  Through Jesus Christ, we have victory over death.  I would like to thank the Holy Father and Pope John Paul for their angelic blessings and all the prayers and support.  And thanks to Father (name unknown) and Guido Todeschini for your love and support.  I want to thank everybody around the world and Father, let your will be done.  I am going to keep this statement short.  I love you all.  I am ready, Warden.
