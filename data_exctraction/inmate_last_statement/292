  I would like to thank all my loved ones that are standing over there for all the kindness and support you have shown me over the years.  Be strong.  Do not hate, but learn from this experience.  Just because it happens, do not think that God doesn't care.  He will be with you.  I will be there with all of you.  I love you all and appreciate all of you.  You won't be forgotten and there are a lot of people out there that love you.  It has been a blessing to know all of you.  This is not easy for any of us.  Don't be upset about my situation, because I am not.  I am still faithful and I am still strong.  Just give my love to everyone out there.  Don't forget me and burn a candle for me when you can.  I love you all.
