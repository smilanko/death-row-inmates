  Yes sir.  Today I go home to the Lord.  But first, I have to say something.  I am real sorry.  I took family member's life and I shouldn't have.  I hope that you can move on.  I am just sorry.  I don't know what else to say.  I can't bring anyone back.  I would if I could.  I hope you will be fine.  I won't ask for your forgiveness.  God will be my judge.  To my family and friends, I love you all.  You all take care and somebody find Void.  Be strong and I will see you all; hopefully not soon.  Keep your head up.  That is all I have to say.
