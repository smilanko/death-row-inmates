 I told the daughter not to come. Discontinue; be quiet, please. Specifically, I want to say that the bad evil man I was when I came to death row 13 years ago is no more – by the power of God; Jesus Christ; God Almighty; Holy Spirit, he has transformed me as a new creature of Christ. I know that I am a Christ child and that my Lord will welcome me into His arms. Jesus Christ is the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings. I love all of you, those I can and can’t see. With the love of Christ, my love for you is secure and I love you purely and wholeheartedly in the name of the Almighty God.
