  Yes, I do.  To the victim's family, I am sorry you lost a brother, loved one, and friend.  To my family, I love you all.  Keep your heads ups and know I will be in a better place.  And you all look after Aleda and make sure she is a part of this family.  I appreciate you all and love you.  I apologize that you lost a loved one this way.  God bless you all.  O.K. Warden.
