 Yes, I do, Grace Kehler is that you? I have given Warden  Jones a written statement that will explain a lot more. I hope this will bring  you closure and answers to some questions. I hope this will bring you peace and  I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering. I'm sorry it went on for a terribly  long time. I'm sorry to you especially Grace Kehler. To the Kehler, Johnson and  Crain family, I pray that you won't hate Jesus, the letter will explain more.  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I hope that my death will bring you peace and closure. I  pray that maybe someday will bring you peace. I hope that you could forgive me,  but if you don't I understand. I don't think I could forgive anyone who would  of killed my children. I'm sorry for your suffering you've had for a long time.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I love you Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus. Â
